			The Gorilla DAO is BSV's very first Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).
			<br>
			Only 2,100,000 Ape Tokens exist‚Äìowning Ape Tokens gives you voting rights in the DAO.
			<br>
			No Ape Tokens were distributed for free. Every member of the DAO, even the Gorillas who created it, bought the Ape Utility Token to gain membership.
			<br>
			For every "/pay $1.00" to the Gorilla Organization on
			Twetch you will receive 1 Ape Token (price is subject to change due to law of supply and demand as well as community governance.)
			<br>
			The money paid to the Gorilla Organization for the Ape Tokens will live in the Gorilla Treasury(38436@moneybutton.com + the Gorilla DAO twetch wallet [1NDRbtKx2WE4Fvqr9sPqfdUexnAdLvvBtz]). The Gorilla Treasury is the DAO‚Äôs actionable capital.
			<br>
			A DAO does whatever its members want it to do. It is up to the members of the DAO to steer the ship that is the DAO through creating and voting on proposals that decide how the DAO should act and/or use its capital.
			<br>
			The goal is for the Gorilla DAO to be truly autonomous and operate through smart contracts.
			<br>
			As the first DAO to launch on the BSV blockchain, The Gorilla DAO, and each of its members, is making history.
