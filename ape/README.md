## Todo
# propose page -> demo of proposal submission, write initial proposal on chain, store comments in db
	- eventually comments on chain as well perhaps? for now have user input matterlink
	- save author so user can input link later if its that urgent
	- maybe commit link on chain eventually i dunno 
# proposals page -> look into marking the proposals with some kind of tag to be acheived from chain, or just link via db and pull tx data down

## Done
# make token test functional, rename page and have nav links to propose/proposals
